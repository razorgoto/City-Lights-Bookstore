## City Lights Bookstore

City Lights Bookstore

I am upstairs in the poetry room. Browsing. I see an anthology of Michelle Tea’s work and sit down. Some kid is writing furiously in an elementary school notebook with a red pen.

San Francisco! City Lights Bookstore! Fuck. I never thought in my lifetime that I would see this place. Now, I am here. Wow! What a fucking let down. City Lights is just like the giant chain bookstores from back home. Kerouac hung out here? This place published Howl? Ferlinghetti owned this yupster dive and installed floodlights and faux hardwood floor?

Fuck, whatever.

I sit down and the kid moves away his things. “I don’t want to get in your way,” he says. But he isn’t and I say so. I keep reading.

Michelle Tea turns out to be really fucking good. Line breaks. Yeah. Leah told me about her once, when she was teaching me oral poetry. Leah used Tea as an example. Reading her now, I can almost hear each line by line by the position of the line breaks. So easy to follow. Each slipping into each -- congealing the whole poem into a syllogism of desire.

I get up to browse some more. Bao Dao. Justin and Marilyn Chin. After thinking about what David Mura said, I am hoping to find a writer with a similar experience as me — a generation one-point-five Chinaman.

I am staring at book spines. An old man walks up the stairs. He pitches his eyes forward across the room like Clint Eastwood in a Spaghetti -Western saloon. He marches to the middle of the room and booms, “If anybody has any questions, let me know.”

Who is he? It’s like he owns the place. He bee-lines over and turns to the kid writing at my table, “You working?” The old man starts asking the kid about his poetry. I have never seen this in Toronto: an older writer giving mentorship to a younger one in the middle of a bookstore.

He is a great guy, but the old man is kinda disturbing me. I am trying to concentrate on Marilyn Chin but the old man and his fast-talking is full of punctuated pops. He enunciates each stress syllable like it’s a pointed exclamation mark. His questions don’t end with a rising tone, but a full declarative deadpan. I am trying to ignore him and he has full-out ignored me. That’s alright, I guess. What else is he suppose to do with a Chinaman in the poetry section?

Finally the old man says to the kid, “You keep writing about that. I’ll come back in half– an– hour and you can read it back to me.” The kid says OK and the old man leaves. I return to my browsing.

No. Nothing. I can’t find a poet that represents Chinamen like me. Nobody even close. Maybe first generation immigrant kids from Hong Kong don’t write much poetry.

I suppose I shouldn’t complain. This is still a really cool poetry section; not everybody featured on this shelf is dead. Back home in Toronto, the bookstores that sell poetry resemble Chinese altars for the veneration of long-ago ancestors. I guess there is still some hope here in SF: that good poets are still writing and readers are still buying the stuff. At fifteen to twenty bucks a pop, too!

I turn back to the kid again. He is reading Howl. I laugh at him under my breath. I sit back down to the table again to write this down. I am writing everything down as it happens. This strange encounter at City Lights Bookstore where I meet a kid reading one of the most famous works of the Twentieth-Century, at the place where it was published. The old man and everything. And everything is so nonchalant.

The kid is talking to me again, interrupting the flow of my writing down this story about him. Why is he talking to me? I am supposed to be the neutral third-party observer, recording my amazement down. I hope my participation in the narrative will not interfere interfere with it.

"... you ... to ... -ing?" The kid asks.

What the fuck? I can’t understand a word he's saying. His accent. That Southern drawl is soothing to the heart but slippery to the brain.

"I am sorry. I am from Canada,” I apologize, like so many Canadians before me. “I don’t really understand your accent."

"Wow! That’s wild! So you don’t know what I am saying?"

I shake my head.

I maneuver him into playing a game where I try guessing his accent. I am usually pretty good at it. I do it all the time with hot international students at coffee shops in Toronto. It’s a great icebreaker. It also gives me time to adjust to a new accent.

“North Carolina!”
“No.”
“North ... Dakota?”
“Haha, no.”
I peer into his sky blue eyes and take a deep breath. “You are from South Dakota. I know. Don’t lie to me.”
He is giggling. Women usually giggle when I do that.
“No. I am from Tennessee.”
“Oh, like Nashville?”
“Yeeeea,” he drags out his "e’s" like tapered legs slipping out of silk stockings.
“Cool, what are you doing here?”
The kid takes a deep breath, “Well ...,” he begins.

I have him hooked. He is telling me stories. About him doing missionary work in Golden Gate Park. About the difficulties he had with other missionaries: Double-speakers who lived in soft, comfortable rooms while their homeless flock is out sleeping under the stars. He tells me about going to Big Sur, the Henry Miller Museum, the sushi and wine dinner party there, and afterward, completely drunk and lost and surviving in the desert for two days without water. Then walked away, unknown and forgotten, to here in North Beach.

Enthralled by his stories, his eyes, his mouth, only the old man coming back breaks the spell.

“So have you gotten that piece written yet?” He asks the kid.

“Yeah. Let me show it to you,” He flips to the last page of his tattered notebook that has only one sentence written on it.

“Man throws pizza at suit —.” he proudly proclaims. Then his face falls as the old man arches a grey and bushy eyebrow “— It's just like a mental note,” he apologizes.

The old man grins. Understanding and forgiving.

He offers to redeem himself to the old man, “I can read you another poem.”

He flips that tattered grade school notebook of his back and forth for a few minutes. He gives a small pause at the right page and reads a really long poem about police beating him up. Set in rhymes, in heroic couplets. The language is dull.

The old man nods in approval.

“Wait,” the kid says, “I wrote a chorus for it.”

He slurs something in equal parts of incomprehensible sludge and of cliche.

“I don’t think I like that,” The old man says.

Wordlessness hangs for a few moments. The kid keeps smiling and the old man grins and glares. He doesn’t blink. I have nothing to say about his poetry. Neither to the crappy protest poem nor to the antics of these weird people. In my head I am telling myself, “The kid works hard. He will probably be very good in another ten years. If he just writes as he speaks instead of what he reads from some dead pink people.”

But these people and their gleaming, supernatural ecstasy. They are so outside my realm of experiences. I am distrusting of the unknown. Their zen. Their lounge hunger. I half-wish the sphinx of cement and aluminum does bash their skulls open and eat their brains and imagination.

But they are so warm. So ... genuine. The old man breaks the static silence and they talk about the leftist cafe they both performed at and the protests in the parks where they probably shared a microphone at some point.

I am disappointed at SF again. The kid has potential but he is still young and, therefore, bad. He is really really bad. If I heard him reading at a bar, I would walk out and leave. I would quit if I was as bad as him. But that is probably what will make him good. He won’t quit. White people have no shame. Generation one-point-five Chinamen go off to be accountants.

The old man asks the kid, “You wanna get a drink?”

“Sure,” the boy answers, “Let me finish this book first. This is my first time reading Howl.”

I want to tell him that Howl ought to be read out loud. In my old house in Kingston, I kept a copy in the bathroom. When I was taking a shit I would read from it — for elocutionary practice. I want to tell him that too. But I feel uncomfortable sharing this in front of the old man, who is still grinning and glaring like a copper sheet dented in by baseball bats. I don’t think he minds: The old man would probably like sharing his scatological habits as well.

The old man starts sharing all he knows about Howl. He does not tell the kid about the metric quality of Ginsburg’s most famous work. Instead, he goes in length on the book’s long battle with obscenity charges that went all the way to the Supreme Court. He continues, recommending more books to the kid: To Kill a Mocking Bird, some books on Liberation Theology, a few writers I never heard of. The kid dutifully writes it all down on a clean page in the same tattered baby blue notebook.

“We should go,” the old man, looking to the kid, says, “You’re old enough to go to a bar, right?”

“Yeah, but I don’t have ID on me.”

“We can go to Vesuvio. It’s never a problem. I bring this underage kid there all the time. He is my protege,” He chuckles.

“OK,” the kid says. And then he says to me, “Oh wait, I forgot to introduce myself. I am Sky,” He extends his hand to me. I take it and introduce myself.

“And this is Marc,” the kid points to the old man. Marc only nods.

“Sam,” the kid addresses me, “you wanna get a drink with us?”

I want to. I really want to. This is what I always imagined San Francisco to be. This is why I am here. Seeing BEATS, and this was is so fucking BEAT. I'd been in this stink hole of a city for ten days, and all I'd met were yuppies and tourist-yuppies. Constipated, consuming yuppies like me. Finally, BEATNIKS!!!!

“No,” I say, “I gotta go home to Canada tomorrow. Besides, I don’t drink beer.”

Sky, sly, winks at me and says, “Only whisky, right?”

“How did you know?” Still mesmerized, I ask.

He smiles.

He asks for my email. I look at his grinning, prairie blond face and realized that I like him. I like him a lot. This angelheaded hipster. I give him my real email address, though I have no intentions of ever receiving anything from him. I don’t care. He had let me take a small peek at his beatnik world. Me. This little Chinaman interloper from Canada.

I am still writing down my email on his notebook. when Marc breaks into an impromptu performance of O Canada! Sky stands up singing too and they walk downstairs in song.

Amazed. Thinking myself silly. Here I was, all afraid. I thought this Beat shrine — with hardwood floors and flood lights — was all yuppified. And then, these fellas. There are still this Beat stuff here at the heart of North Beach. These 21st century beatniks. Still with radiant cool eyes. Strange people — yes — but very happy.

The bookstore is closing. I walk out, but before I leave, I ask the clerk at the counter about Marc. He furrows his eyebrows as I describe the craggy face, curly-hair, WuMu cotton bag with stacks of paper sticking out, and loud.

“Oh, you mean Marc,” he exhales, “I am glad you told us about the guy. I am so sorry. We try to keep an eye out for him.”

“Who is he?”

“Just some annoying guy who thinks he is a poet. He reads his shit and people tells him to shut up. Yeah. He gets a little too comfortable here.” He adjusts his stylish, black-rimmed glasses. His sweater is gray, plain, and expensive. Fucking snoot. Can’t even speak properly, and tries to sound intelligent by using no contractions.

Another clerk in a mauve, one-piece patterned dress walks over. Fabric painted with splashing fingers of beige, flowing in diagonal, stylishly whirling near her left breast. She adds, “He was singing O Canada.” They both roll their eyes in one swift synchronized movement.

“No, no,” I say, “I'm from Canada, and that’s why he was singing.”

“Oh, I am so sorry,” the first clerk says.

“No, no, he's cool.”

I have nothing else to say to these people. These bookstore clerks whose building is judgement. Hiding my disgust, I say goodbye and leaves. Crossing the entryway of the store, a worrying thought strikes me about Sky. That Marc guy, according to those two snooty bookstore clerks, is some kind of weirdo. And this weirdo just took Sky somewhere in the sinister San Francisco night. That's not good.

I rush out. I walk all around Columbus trying to find the two of them. All over. Strip-joints, Italian restaurants, sex shops, and cafes. They are gone.

I go back to the bookstore and all the lights are out. I pass by Jack Kerouac Lane. Some impulse takes me to walk through that little dark alleyway behind City Lights.

I look down on the inscriptions set in bronze plate. I didn’t know that Kerouac is such a Sinophile. In the pavement are lines of permanent poetry. Half in Chinese, half in Beat. What choice of words to set in place forever! They are companions. Kerouac and Li Pao. They were like verses in koan poems — each line seeking the companion of the other. Perhaps I did find what I was looking for: people like me.

Like Li Pao, I look down in thought. Looking away, I look up. No, not the moon. It’s a bar: Vesuvio. Right next door to City Lights. Separated by Jack Kerouac Lane. Bookstore and the bar separated by lines of poetry.

In the window of the second floor, I see Sky and Marc. The first reading, and the second nodding furiously to each pounding stress of some bad poem. Maniac grins spreading all around.
